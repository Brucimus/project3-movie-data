About the movie API
The way we watch movies has changed massively over the past decades and continues to be a dominating part of our lives that continues to advance. Whether watching in a small or large movie theater, we have more choices available to us than ever before. Using the dataset from kaggle, TMDB Movie Dataset, for example, we can grab  run times, revenue, budget, genres,and popularity from various ways.
What we expect from TMDB Movie Dataset is to find the average run time and revenue has changed based on recent popularity spikes in the most current times. We can measure if movie budgets match with popularity or voter counts. We can check genre changes based on year.
