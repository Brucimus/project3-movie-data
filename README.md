About the movie dataset
The way we watch movies has changed massively over the past decades and continues to be a dominating part of our lives that continues to advance. Whether watching in a small or large movie theater, we have more choices available to us than ever before.

This dataset is set out to help to someone who wants to enter into the movie industry. However if that person has no prior knowledge of the industry and needs help this data set is set to help them build a successful movie studio.

We lay the foundation by looking for answers on certain questions. How much should you spend to make a successful movie? Which genres are the most profitable? How much is spent to make a top rated movie?

In the revenue page, it is a summary of how well budget runtime and vote averages correlate with revenue.

Afterwords we check the correlations between genres and revenue. In these charts, its noticable how much 
action and adventuure generate more revenue compared to other genres. In terms of money being made, more drama and comedy movies are made within the industry.

Popularity is measured by the users of tmdb website. Users can vote and the database holds number of votes for certain days, as well as number of daily views. With this you can see average ratings of 6-8 have higher viewer retention than other movies in a 1-10 scaling.
